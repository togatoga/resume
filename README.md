### Knowledge about SAT Solver
My research was the acceleration and parallelization of SAT Solver.
I have good knowledge about SAT Solver algorithm and implementation.  
I parallelized minisat(https://github.com/niklasso/minisat) by Message Passing Interface and also re-implemented minisat for the competitive programming.  
I listed my SAT Solver codes in Projects, you can see it.

### Competitive Programming
I love studying algorithm and competitive programming,so I regularly participate in contests, TopCoder, AtCoder, Codeforces.  
My handle names are **togatogah**, **togatoga**. I'm a yellow coder at TopCoder,have intermediate knowledge about algorithms(math,graph,sort,string,dynamic programming).  
I also have interests about the Game AI, I achieved good results in some Game AI contests(CodeVS5.0,Hypersonic).
